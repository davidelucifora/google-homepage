# Google Homepage
A Google Homepage Search Results page replica for Odin Project.
The Exercise requried to just create a simple Replica of the Google Homepage. However I decided to take it a bit further and create a replica of a search results page, which requries some extra steps and knowledge, making it more challenging.

****************************************

Part of the Odin Project Curriculum to learn Git, HTML and CSS. 

The aim of this project is to learn to use browser DevTools and HTML/CSS to create a replica of the Google Homepage. 
To further consolidate my learnings, I decided to create a full search results page instead, where an Image grid is displayed, an accordion for the "People also ask" section and other things that weren't required in the exercise but felt like a good personal challenge.

Tech used: HTML5, CSS3.
Main Learnings: CSS Flexbox, CSS Grid
